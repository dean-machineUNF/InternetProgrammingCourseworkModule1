			<h2 class="red">About Me</h2>
			<p>I am a Computer and Information Science post-bacc student at UNF. I am pursuing this degree because I want to work as a software developer after my degree is complete next spring. I am currently applying to and interviewing for software development internships for this summer and am hoping to get one.</p>
			<p>Something interesting about me is that I taught English courses here at <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_North_Florida" target=blank>UNF<a/> before deciding to pursue a career in software development.</p>
			<br>
			<h2 class="blue">Hobbies & Interests</h2>
			<p>One of my favorite hobbies is hiking and exploring new state parks. In the picture above, I am hiking through <a class="link" href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Duro_Canyon" target=blank>Palo Duro Canyon<a/> in northern Texas. I prefer hiking in the southwest to hiking in the southeast due to the unique rock formations in the southwest.</p>
			<p>My other favorite pastimes are reading on the beach, watching a horror movie, or watching/playing any sport.</p> 
			<br>
			<h2 class="green">Education</h2> 
			<p>My educational goal is to learn enough about programming to be hired as a <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_developer" target=blank>software developer</a> and then to continue learning and growing as a programmer at my job.</p>
			<p>To accomplish my goal of becoming a software developer, I am currently completing a CIS degree at UNF. Listed below are my degrees.</p>
